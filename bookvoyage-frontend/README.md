# Book Voyage Front-End

## Getting up to speed
This project was developed in Typescript using the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli). You will first need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), which will include the package manager `npm`. If you run `npm install` in the `bookvoyage-frontend` folder, you will install Angular CLI and all other dependencies of the project. Pretty neat, right?

If you have never used the framework before, kudos to Maximilian for developing [this excellent course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/). Using an IDE rather than a plain text editor will make your life easier (despite the excellent error handling of Angular). [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) worked wonders, but is expensive for non-students. If anyone has good alternatives to suggest, please make a pull request :smile:

### Development server

Once installed, run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. You're now ready to make changes and see them reflected live in your browser.
